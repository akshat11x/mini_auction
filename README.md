## Deploy to Render (single Dockerfile)

This repo includes a Dockerfile that builds the React client and serves it from the Node/Express server. To deploy on Render:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Create a new Web Service on Render, choose "Deploy from a repository" and select this repo.
3. Select "Docker" for Runtime. Render will auto-detect the Dockerfile at the repo root.
4. Environment:
    - Set `NODE_ENV=production`.
    - Provide required secrets for server (e.g., `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, etc.).
5. Health check path: `/healthz` (optional).
6. Save and deploy. Render sets `PORT`; the app listens on it.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The workflow `.github/workflows/render-deploy.yml` will:
- Install and build client and server
- Build the Docker image to validate the Dockerfile
- Trigger a Render deploy via Deploy Hook URL

Set the repository secret `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` with your service Deploy Hook (Render Dashboard > your service > Settings > Deploy Hook).
